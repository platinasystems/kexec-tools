.SH NAME
kexec \- Tool to load a kernel for warm reboot and initiate a warm reboot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kexec
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBkexec\fP allows one to load another kernel from the currently running 
Linux kernel. Normally one would load a kernel, and possibly an initial 
ramdisk, into the currently running kernel using kexec and then initiate
a warm reboot by executing kexec again with appropriate option.
